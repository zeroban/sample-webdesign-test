  <h1> <b> Rainbow Six Siege is currently on Year 4 Season 2.</b> </h1>
  <h2> <strong>NØkk</strong> </h2>
  <p> In year 4 Season 2 we was introduced to two new characters NØkk and Warden. NØkk's has the ultimate form of stealth technology. Her HEL is a glove
attachment that when activated hides her image from the opponents observation tools. Drones, Bulletproof Cameras, Evil Eyes and more will no longer be able to detect her. 
thous giving her the ability to roam the map with out being detected. However her gadget does have a cooldown and once depleted takes some time to recharge. How ever roaming
may be more risky for defenders when NØkk is around. </p>

  <h2> <strong>Warden</strong> </h2>
   <p> Warden's gadget is glance which was allows him to see through smoke screen and prevents him from being blinded from a flash bang. If he does happen to get flashed he can simply
   activate his gadget and remove the effect. With his ability he can turn the tieds on attackers who attempt to make a push while in the cover of a smoke screen. However his gadget doesn't
   come without a flaw. While glance is active warden must remain still, otherwise he will be effected by the smoke or flash bang like everyone else. </p>
