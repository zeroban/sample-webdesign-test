  <h1> <b> Rainbow Six Siege </b> </h1>
  <p> Rainbow Six Siege was first released on December 1,2015 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox1. On November 12, 2015 PC players would be able to download the standard edition to play as well. The game was published by Ubisoft. Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person tactical shooter that has one team defending an objective and another team trying to attack the objective. There are different modes you can play whether it is Bomb where the defenders have to defend two different location from the attacking team. The attacking teamâ€™s objective is to push into one of the locations and plant a diffuser to destroy the bombs. Another mode is Hostage where they defenders have a hostage they must protect, and the attackers must extract the hostage without them dying. One more mode is Secure Area where the defenders must hold a location from the attacking team. When the attacking team enters the location, it begins securing and the defending team must get back into the location to stop the attackers from securing. The last game mode is Terrorist Hunt where it simulates you playing as a recruiter going through training to kind of teach you the mechanics on how the game is played to get you used to how it feels to move around and control the character.    </p>
