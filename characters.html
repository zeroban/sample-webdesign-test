		<h2> <strong> Attackers </strong> </h2>
		
	<p6> Attackers specialize in many different areas. You have the main most used character 
		Ash who is a 3 speed 1 armour character which specializes in making quick entery points 
		though soft none reinforced walls. She has a launcher that she can use that shoots a 
		breaching charge that will hit walls and explode after a second or two. You also have the
		choice to play characters that specialize in breaching reinforced walls to make more entry
		points to objective. Theses operators tend to be 2 speed 2 armour. Which means they may not
		be as fast as Ash but can withstand more shots then Ash. You also have to option to play Lion 
		which is a 3 armour 1 speed character that has a guadget that causes a shock wave that when activated 
		if there are any defending character moving it will reveal their location to his team. His ability is good 
		for slowing down roaming defenders.</p6>

		<h2> <strong> Defenders </strong> </h2>
		
	<p6> Defenders specialize in many entry denial tactics. You have the opton to play Bandit
		who specializes in stopping attackers from breaching reinforced walls with his bandit
		batteries he places on them to electrify them. Any electronic device that comes in contract
		with a wall they he has electrified with be intantly destroyed. You alway have the option to play 
		either Rook or Doc who are 3 armour and 1 speed which allows them with withstand many bullets with 
		with Doc on the scene you can expect him to be healing all his wounded comrads back to full health. 
		But all attackers should be cautious when running in if There is a Caviera on the scene.
		Caviera specializes in stealth and interigation. If come up against Caviera be sure to sweep all 
		rooms carefully and do not leave no corners unchecked for if she downs you she can intergiate you 
		and force you to tell where all your commrades are at. When she interigates you all allies will become
		visable through walls for your whole team. </p6>
