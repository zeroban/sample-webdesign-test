  <h2> <strong> Ember Rise </strong> </h2>
  <p> Expect all new  stratagies with the arrival of Year 4 Season 3 characters Amaru and Goyo and the new rework of Kanal!</p>
  
<div class="info">
	<div class="column">
		<h2> Amaru </h2>
		<p6> Amaru is the newest eddition to the attacking team. Amaru believes speed is key whe 
		trying to take an objective or rescue a hostage. Amaru is equiped with what she calls the 
		Garra Hook which is truly a unique contraption. Amaru can grapple to to ledges, windows, and even hatches.
		Defenders now not only do they have to worry about attacks from above but also from below. With the Garra
		she can now go up through upen hatches. Also if timed just right you can grapple to a window and
		result in Amaru's famous kick which will intantly kill any defender standing on the other side of the window. 
		Amaru can now reach many windows that could not have been reached before. Amaru's Garra Hook will open up many new breaching 
		possibilities. </p6>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h2> Goyo </h2>
		<p6> With the arrival of Goyo the newest member of the defensive family you can expect great things from him.
		Goyo give a new dangerous meaning to deception. Goyo is equipped with 3 deployable shields that's used to block 
		pathway of attackers and resemmbles any ordinary shield. However Goyo turns up the heat with and attached incendiary 
		bomb. When looking at the shield from the front there is no way to know if its booby trapped or not. Even once the 
		bomb has been degnated it still continues to be an obsticle for attackers. Hopefully Goyo's teammates will remember to 
		save that explosive for when an attacker is standing infront of the shield or climbing over it. </p6>

<div class="map">
	<div class="Kanal">

	<h2> <strong> Kanal </strong> </h2>
	<p6> Its been a long time coming for the rework of the map Kanal. To start off players will be able to rotate much easier.
	Before with one bridge linking the eastern and western building attackers and defenders could find them selves cut off 
	from the objective area. But now with two bridges players can move though out the buildings more freely. However they will 
	have to cordinate more effectivly in order to cover all entry points. While having two linking bridges makes navigation much easier 
	They also included two stair cases to make vertical movement more accessible. Each building now has two and are color coded to simplify
	call-outs. On top of all of that they also incresed the number of indoor playable areas and expanded others all while slowing down objective pushing. </p6>
